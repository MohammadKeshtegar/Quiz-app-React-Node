# Project description

Hi everyone, This project that i'm currently working on it is a Quiz application using React and Node.js. It still has some problems and needs to work on it, so far i made the functionality of creating quiz and deleting and confirming a quiz, also most of the UI works is done, beside these i want to create a chat, so users can create groups and chat with each other through them, it might be unnecessary but personally think it'll be more real world to add chat ability to the application.
<br />
For the front-end i used vite to create the React project and Tailwind CSS for styling components, and for the back-end Node.js and Express beside the MongoDB Atlas database are the technologies i used for. i will let a sample of my config file for connecting to the database and also some another option.

# Installation

For the front-end navigate to `/client` folder and run

```bash
npm install
// OR
npm i
```

<br />

For the back-end side similarly go to `/server` folder and run

```bash
npm install
// OR
npm i
```

# Run the project

After installation, in the `/client` folder run

```bash
npm run dev
```

and for the back-end, navigate to `/server` and run

```bash
npm start
```

and you should be good to go.
